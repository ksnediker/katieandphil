			<div class="text-content" id="bridesmaids-container">
				<div class="content" id="bridesmaids">
					<h3 class="party">Melissa Streckewald</h3>
					<p class="content">Melissa is Katie's older sister. She was lucky enough to spend the first 12 years of her life as an only child, until Katie arrived... Some of Melissa's favorite things to do to her little sister included nuggies, fish-hooks and wet willies. Katie finally got fed up one day and chased Melissa into her room with a knife (a butter knife, to be clear). They eventually reached a truce and their relationship went on to be much more sisterly. Katie was even the Maid of Honor in Melissa's wedding. Melissa is the mother of three of Katie's four nieces: Emily, Isabella and Violette.</p>
					<h3 class="party">Angie Snediker</h3>
					<p class="content">Angie is Katie's younger sister by just 19 months, so they grew up very close. Taking to heart many of her older sister's lessons, Katie could be quite the bully when they were little - frequently using her much greater body mass to her advantage. Angie's main tools of retaliation were her teeth and fingernails; one time the family doctor diagnosed Katie with "cat-scratch fever" after seeing claw marks on her wrists. In high school, their relationship became much more about sports, as they were teammates on both the field hockey and swim teams. Now, in their older age they've taken up golf. Angie is mother of Katie's youngest niece, Sage.</p> 
					<h3 class="party">Katie Luthringer</h3>
					<p class="content">Katie (along with Lauren and Julie) better knows the bride as "Biza," a name thrust upon Katie (Snediker) by her new co-workers on her first day of work at with them at Tony Walker Apothecary back in 2007. Katie (Luthringer) has been a constant source of joy and entertainment since their friendship began nearly 10 years ago. Biza, Katie, Lauren and Julie have existed in a shared state of near-constant stream of consciousness via group text for the past few years, effectively voiding the nuisances of distance and the demands of social relationships in their immediate vicinity. Katie can always be relied upon to cheer you up when you're feeling down, and she has served as the de facto group psychologist, making sure members of the group survive their frequent life-or-death situations. She also famously came up with one of their many made-up words, including "bonz", which means belly; e.g., "I shouldn't have eaten that entire chicken finger pizza, my bonz hurts and I need to sit here with my pants undone". Katie now lives in Boulder, Colorado and generously offers to let Biza take up residence on her couch whenever she needs to get out of the city for awhile, which is often.</p>
					<h3 class="party">Julie Maggio</h3> 
					<p class="content">Julie (another fellow apothecary employee) is perhaps Biza's most entertaining friend. Julie is an unabashed open book, something that Biza finds highly valuable in a friend. Julie and the rest of the group have many interesting stories they could share, but this website isn't the place for them. You can, however, check out her Snapchat if you're interested in learning more about her - she is a highly dedicated snapper. In addition to her social media skills, Julie is also an extremely talented make-up artist and hair-stylist, and will be working wonders for the wedding.</p>
					<h3 class="party">Lauren Rivett</h3> 
					<p class="content">Lauren is perhaps the most refined member of the group. She is frequently (and understandably) repelled by the content shared in the group-text. But don't think she is terribly timid - she can out-party all of them when push comes to shove. Lauren and Biza developed a close connection while working at the apothecary, as both were Political Science majors at the University at Buffalo. While Biza managed to once earn a C+ in a 101 class, Lauren was perpetually stressed by the prospect of finishing with a 3.9 rather than a 4.0 each semester. All her hard work has paid off, as Lauren is now Chief of Staff for a NY State Senator.</p>

				<div class="content" id="groomsmen">
					<h3 class="party">Wossen Ayele</h3>
					<p class="content">Wossen is the best man and long-time bromantic interest of the groom, from the moment they began sharing their freshman dorm at Yale. What began as a bond over common backgrounds (first generation Americans) and interests (sports, Chappelle&#39;s show, NFL Street), quickly blossomed when Woss began playing rugby and the groom began to routinely rest his head snugly against Woss&#39;s thigh/butt area (typical stuff for locks and #8s, nothing out of the ordinary here). Countless shared scrums, rucks and tackles later, Phil struggles to think of someone he'd prefer to take the field with again (not that it requires much encouragement). In the middle of the night, the bride oftentimes awakens to find the groom restlessly tossing and turning to find the perfect pillow position, all the while mumbling Woss&#39;s name and their old scrum cadence.</p>
					<h3 class="party">Will Alexander</h3>
					<p class="content">Phil and Will had a late-blooming friendship in college, with the only discernible inflection point in the relationship appearing to come via the institution of the now legendary Meaty Friday&#39;s, which had a solid two-year run as a way of life for a small group of students at Yale. Meaty Friday&#39;s quickly transitioned into table&ndash;breaking Saturdays, and then there was no looking back. Whether capturing seagoing vessels in the Cayman Islands, sharing bunk beds in the All Star Suite, disregarding height restrictions while driving U-Hauls into parking garages, or repeatedly failing to kick a rugby ball more than 10 meters down the field, these two have remained close ever since.</p>
					<h3 class="party">Rob Morse</h3> 
					<p class="content">Rob is perhaps the unlikeliest groomsman, given the groom&#39;s instinctive distaste for backs and scrum&ndash;halves in particular. Early interactions included a (justified) dump tackle during a &quot;friendly&quot; game of touch, and being told to &quot;put the damn ball in the scrum and stop talking about back plays.&quot; However, Rob used his persistent and unwavering goodness, devotion to the club, and gutsy rugby performances through injury to break through the groom&#39;s hard outer shell and become a close friend, confidant and future All Star Capital partner. Has a standing bet with Phil regarding whose child will score more tries for Yale Rugby, a wager the groom is surely to lose given his inferior athletic qualities (his preferred method of play is viewed in some circles as less &quot;refined&quot; or &quot;skilled&quot;), although we're confident that Katie's natural abilities will be enough to offset this. </p>
					<h3 class="party">Alex Constantinou</h3> 
					<p class="content">Alex is the older brother of the groom and an all-around solid guy. During their childhood, he oftentimes dealt with the groom pointing the accusatory finger at him for things the groom very obviously had done (their all&ndash;knowing parents saw right through it). Mercifully, he has not held a grudge, or at least is patiently biding his time for revenge. A little known fun fact is that Alex used to frustratedly complain to his parents that the groom was too sensitive, as he repeatedly and openly cried during viewings of movies including Braveheart, The Last Samurai, Gladiator…and even Old School, somehow). Thankfully, the groom has learned how to conceal his emotions beneath a hard facade, while quietly weeping on the inside.</p> 
					<h3 class="party">Nick Constantinou</h3>
					<p class="content">Nick is the younger brother and long-time mini-me of the groom (ask to see pictures of them growing up, they were indistinguishable). While inseparable from the groom during their childhood, Nick's growing interest and talent in music (which is the polar opposite of the musically-handicapped groom) has correlated with increasingly frequent accusations hurled at the groom of being &quot;such a square&quot; or &quot;so establishment, man.&quot; Nick has been photographed with Motley Crue and clearly holds the advantage on the &quot;cool&quot; scale. He's probably voting for Bernie Sanders (just a guess, but pretty sure I'm right), and a likely candidate to wear a sweet t&ndash;shirt tuxedo to the wedding.</p>
